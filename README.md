# The Weather App

## Introduction:

The weather in any city in the world can be simply known with the use of this straightforward weather application. The basic structure of this Weather App has been created using the following HTML and CSS code.

## Working:

* The weather information for all towns and nations was fetched using the APIs in our weather app.
* For the javascript part: We will first create a constant object variable, which will store our object base and key value.
* Now using thedocument.queryselector we will select our input search box and we will add a Keypress EventListener to it, which we will attach to a function called setQuery.
* Now, using the function, we will check if our key value is 13 digits long or not. If it is, then it will search for the city or country you are searching for using the search box.Now we will create another function  which we fetch the weather details using the API, and then it will return the weather details using the.json() method.
* Now we will create a function that will push all the output into our HTML element so that we can display the weather details on the webpage.
